                        <b>Now use eye movement to play computer games London:</b> In an invention that
                        could go a long way in helping the disabled, students have developed a computer
                        game that can be operated by eye movement. The students, from Imperial College London
                        (ICL), have developed an open source game called 'Pong', where a player uses his
                        eye to move a bat to hit a ball as it bounces around the screen. To play the game,
                        the user wears special glasses containing an infrared light and a webcam that records
                        the movement of one eye. The webcam is linked to a laptop where a computer programme
                        syncs the player's eye movements to the game. The prototype game is very simple
                        but students believe that the technology behind it could be adapted to create more
                        sophisticated games and applications such as wheelchairs and computer cursors controlled
                        by eye movements.

                      <b>  Asus launches 3D gaming notebook in India Bangalore:</b> After almost four months of
                        its release, Asus G51J 3D has arrived in India, bundled with specially designed
                        3D glasses and equipped with NVIDIA 3D Vision. ASUS G51J 3D has NVIDIA GeForce GTX
                        260M with 1GB DDR3 video memory. EAX and CMSS audio technology further enhances
                        in-game immersion, delivering crystal clear sound and compelling environment audio
                        effects through bespoke Altec Lansing speakers. ASUS G51J 3D is powered by an Intel
                        Core i7 processor and 64-bit Windows 7 operating system. A pair of 3D Vision active-shutter
                        glasses coupled with a wide-range infra-red emitter delivers stereoscopic images
                        with clarity, brightness and depth-of-field (DOP) at full resolution without any
                        viewing angle restrictions. The GPU driver and a 120Hz 3D panel render each scene
                        twice, delivering up to 60 images evenly to each eye, amounting to a total of up
                        to 120 images at any given time. Gamers can experience total immersion into their
                        games from what were previously flat 2D worlds, to true-to-life 3D.

                      <b>  Scientists develop laser security for Internet Bangalore:</b> Scientists at Tel Aviv
                        University have developed a new security system for Internet using a special laser
                        that will help in keeping hackers' prying eyes off for good. It is developed using
                        fiber optic and computer technology that transmits binary lock-and-key information
                        in the form of light pulses. Dr. Jacob Scheue, who came up with this device, said
                        that a shared key code can be unlocked by the sender and receiver, and absolutely
                        nobody else. "Rather than developing the lock or the key, we've developed a system
                        which acts as a type of key bearer. The trick is for those at either end of the
                        fibre optic link to send different laser signals they can distinguish between, but
                        which look identical to an eavesdropper."

                        text messages, video clips, personal information on a micro SD card, then work with
                        it across device platforms seamlessly with the micro SD Card Reader. It is compatible
                        with USB 2.0, SD Specification Version 2.00.It is shock resistant, dust poof, ESD
                        proof and can take extreme temperature (-25 degree Celsius to 85 degree Celsius).

                        <b>Apple's new iPad already sold out Washington: </b>The first run of Apple's latest product,
                        the iPad, has already sold out this weekend and customers who pre-order now will
                        have to wait an extra nine days after the official U.S. launch to get their hands
                        on it. U.S. customers have been able to order the iPad for two weeks now, and either
                        collect it from the store April 3, or have it delivered. On Saturday, Apple set
                        April 12 as the next date for people to get the iPad. Hundreds of Apple fans are
                        expected to camp outside the company's shops waiting to get their own copy of the
                        touch screen tablet computer. Industry observers believe the iPad could well outsell
                        the Apple's iPhone, launched in 2007, of which 1 million had been sold after 74
                        days on shop shelves.
